# Vet_public

This repository contains all the test dataset of our machine learning model. 
In Vet-main/dataset\ test\ normal\ and\ gradcam, one can find all picture we have. 

Every 000 slice represent the original image, and every 001 slice represent the heatmap output by the model we build in our paper. 
All predictions made on the test set by our model can be found in the dataset_test.csv file.
